📌 Overview

This mini project is part of the SQL learning challenge where I took on the role of a Data Analyst at The Great Pizza.
The objective was to analyze pizza sales data, uncover business insights, and apply SQL concepts learned up to Day 15.

The challenge included database creation, filtering, data cleaning, joins, aggregations, and multi-phase analytical tasks.

Listed unique pizza categories

Inspected missing ingredients

Checked pizzas with missing prices

Reviewed table structure

Phase 2: Filtering & Exploration

Orders on specific dates

Price-based sorting

Size filtering (L, XL)

Price range queries

Searching pizzas by keyword ("Chicken")

Filtering orders after 8 PM

Phase 3: Sales Performance

Total pizzas sold

Average pizza price

Order value per order

Category-wise performance

Categories with >5000 sales

Pizzas never ordered

Price differences across sizes (Self Join)

🧠 Skills Demonstrated

SQL filtering (WHERE, LIKE, IN, BETWEEN)

Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX)

GROUP BY & HAVING

INNER / LEFT / RIGHT / SELF JOIN

Data cleaning with COALESCE, DISTINCT

Query optimization basics

Structured problem-solving

📊 Project Outcome

A comprehensive SQL analysis pipeline uncovering insights across pricing, category trends, and sales behavior.
This strengthened my real-world SQL skills — from data cleaning and filtering to complex joins and analytical reasoning.
